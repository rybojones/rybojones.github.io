### [Orlando Utilities Company Classification](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19DBBbFypyWNO0m0hYJFFmQubP0zeqS_C/view?usp=sharing)

Winner of UCF Big Data Analytics Symposium 2021 competition with the stated goal of disaggregating Orlando Utilities Commission customer load usage and classifying customers with an electric vehicle. Working with large data (25+ billion records in some tables) in a SnowFlake data warehouse, we were able to define a domain knowledge model that outperformed traditional machine learning models by achieving, on average, 10%+ higher accuracy, precision and recall.

### [Diabetes Mellitus Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/widsdatathon2021/overview)

Collaborating with a team of close female peers, I am participating in the Women in Data Science 2021 Datathon organized by Kaggle. We are working to identify ICU patients with Diabetes Mellitus based on initial diagnostic data, with the aim to reduce mortality rate. We have been lucky to organize meetings with domain experts who provide valuable information. This exchange of information will enable us to create an ensemble method, utilizing medical research and data science to create a better performing model.

### [Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/rybojones/MSDA-Recommendation-System)

In an attempt to identify consumer propensity towards specific movie genres, I constructed user-movie ratings models, utilizing KMeans and Alternating Least Squares algorithms, and employed PySpark as part of a graduate school project focusing on machine learning using cloud computing techniques. These models attempted to predict user ratings for movies that had not yet been rated.

### [Twitter Natural Language Processing](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ryan.jones1301#!/)

I utilized natural language processing techniques to perform sentiment analysis and topic modeling for all U.S. Senate and House of Representative member Tweets in the month leading up to the 2020 Presidential election. These findings provided insight into the limitations of sentiment analysis on social media text and how context can be obfuscated when using such a technique.

### [TotyotaLift Clustering and Time-Series Modeling](https://github.com/rybojones/Capstone-Toyota)

I am working as a member of a small consultancy team for Southern States ToyotaLift to fulfill my Capstone requirement for graduation. We have been tasked with predicting the point in time that the maintenance cost per hour becomes greater than the purchase cost per hour of a forklift. We are using SCRUM software development process as we create a model to fulfill the business specifications and implementing this workflow using GitHub Projects.
